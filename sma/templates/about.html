                    <p>The explosion of Online Social Media in the form of user-generated content on blogs, microblogs (Twitter), discussion forums, product reviews and multimedia sharing sites presents many new opportunities and challenges to both producers and consumers of information. For producers, this user-generated content provides a rich source of implicit consumer feedback. Tracking the pulse of the ever-expanding social media outlets, enables companies to discern what consumers are saying about their products, which provides useful insight on how to improve and market products better. For consumers, the plethora of information and opinions from diverse sources helps them tap into the wisdom of crowds, to aid in making more informed decisions. Though there is a vast quantity of information available, the consequent challenge is to be able to analyze the large volumes of user-generated content and the implicit (or explicit) links between users, in order to glean meaningful insights therein.</p>
